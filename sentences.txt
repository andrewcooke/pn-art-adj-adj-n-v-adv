# each non-comment line contains a unix epoch, followed by a sentence,
# encoded in ascii, and terminated by a newline character (unix style).

# the epoch is the time at which the sentence was created.  obviously there
# may be some delay before it is visible.  sentences 'end' when the next one
# is created.  the gap is typically of order 50000 seconds, but is not
# guaranteed (there is a random - stochastic - component as well as the
# possibility of service downtimes, etc).

# blank lines and those starting with a # are comments.
